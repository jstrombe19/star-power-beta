The ranges defined for the solar yield array are determined by the angular rotation
to which they are tied. The z axis angular rotation is the pivot of the solar array
along its length, which would alter its position with respect to the rear surface
of the spacecraft. 

The x axis angular rotation is the pivot of the solar array at its point of connection,
either falling below or extending beyond the point at which it is normal to the side
of the spacecraft.
